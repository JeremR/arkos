ARK is a project to produce custom setup scripts and guides for hosting decentralized server infrastructure on a Raspberry Pi. The goal is to reduce the overhead for owning a completely self-hosted server by as much as possible. Thus making the Raspberry Pi into an easy-to-use and easy-to-manage server solution is key.

More details to come.
